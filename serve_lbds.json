    "abstract": "The music industry attracts a large number of investors due to its high turnover. Releasing hit songs can garner profits, whereas flop songs lead to losses. Thus, predicting the popularity of a song before its release can help in promotion plans. Can we really predict hit Songs? This is the main motivation of the work. Extensive work is being done for western songs, but Indian music is relatively less explored. Hence, our work aims to predict hit songs of Indian origin using acoustic features. To analyze tracks, a data set is created from data provided by the Spotify Web API. The features are extracted using Spotify, available libraries such as Librosa and aubio, which are passed to machine learning algorithms for prediction. Along with available features, melodic features based on patterns are proposed and extracted. A comparative analysis is done for four acoustic feature sets containing timbral, pitch, rhythm and melodic features proposed. Further experimentation is performed with the combined features sets resulting in the improved performance. The results are encouraging and hit song prediction can be a reality in the near future.",

    "abstract": "FixMatch, a semi-supervised learning method proposed for image classification, includes unlabeled data instances into the training procedure by predicting labels for differently augmented versions of the unlabeled data. In our previous work, we adapted FixMatch to audio classification by applying image augmentations to spectral representations of the audio signal. While this approach matched the performance of the supervised baseline with only a fraction of the training data, the performance of audio-specific augmentation techniques, and their effect on the FixMatch approach was not evaluated. In this work, we replace all image-based augmentation techniques with audio-specific ones and keep the feature extraction unchanged. The audio-specific approach improved upon the supervised baseline which confirms the effectiveness of the FixMatch approach for semi-supervised learning even with a completely different set of augmentations. However, the image-based approach outperforms the audio-based approach on the three audio classification tasks evaluated.",

    "abstract": "The extraction of fundamental frequency (F0) information from music recordings is a crucial task in the field of music information retrieval. The sequence of F0-estimates over successive time frames (also called F0-trajectory) often corresponds to a melodic phrase and serves as a representation for downstream tasks such as automatic music transcription and performance analysis. A large number of algorithms and tools for F0-estimation have been proposed in the literature and implemented in various programming languages. However, these heterogeneous implementations are often not easily comparable and may vary considerably in performance and accuracy, which is problematic for reproducible research. In this contribution, we introduce libf0, a Python library of reference implementations that can conveniently be used to apply, compare, and develop F0-estimation algorithms in a reproducible way.",

    "abstract": "The pitch bend is used as a tool in a virtual instrument/synth that allows one to glide smoothly from one note to another. Almost all virtual instruments today employ the pitch bend joystick/wheel on a keyboard to solely manipulate the fundamental frequency or the pitch of the note being played. While this feature allows a perceptually realistic reproduction of slides in a few instruments (especially wind instruments), it largely fails to do so with plucked string instruments, especially non-Western traditional instruments. In this abstract, we chose to study the meend technique in Sitar performance in order to understand in finer detail the factors (including, but not limited to, the fundamental frequency) that characterize the glide between two notes.",

    "abstract": "To date, little is known about the impact of different source locations on the listener's emotional response to music. Here we investigated through machine learning whether four music source locations (front, back, left, and right) could be accurately differentiated according to the type of valence in a subject-wise manner using spectral features extracted from electrophysiological (EEG) data. The results show that the four source locations can accurately be classified by different EEG correlates and that the effect is stronger when music characterized by negative emotional valence is played outside the listener's field of view. This proof-of-concept study may pave the way for advanced spatial audio analysis approaches in music information retrieval by taking into account the listener's emotional impact depending on the source direction of incidence.",

    "abstract": "Music recommendation systems are researched from multiple aspects, and the recent focus has been on the relationship between physiological measures and music preference. These studies, however, face the challenge of varying acoustic features among stimuli, which can con-found with the effect of preference. Also, access to physiological signals is often limited in real-life applications such as smart devices. In this study, we aimed to reduce the effect of acoustic variability by presenting different expressions of the same musical piece while connecting the study to daily use by shortening the stimulus length. We predicted participants\u2019 preference for musical expressions from cardiac and respiratory data measured from 30 subjects in a psychophysiological experiment. We identified a non-linear relationship between physiological signals and musical preference over an ultrashort time interval (~15 s). This result suggests that music recommendation systems can use biological signals to adapt their model rapidly on minimal data retrieval.",

    "abstract": "Music structure analysis (MSA) systems aim to segment a song recording into non-overlapping sections with useful labels. Previous MSA systems typically predict abstract labels in a post-processing step and require the full context of the song. By contrast, we recently proposed a supervised framework, called \"Music Structural Function Analysis\" (MuSFA), that models and predicts meaningful labels like 'verse' and 'chorus' directly from audio, without requiring the full context of a song. However, the performance of this system depends on the amount and quality of training data. In this paper, we propose to repurpose a public dataset, HookTheory Lead Sheet Dataset (HLSD), to improve the performance. HLSD contains over 18K excerpts of music sections originally collected for studying automatic melody harmonization. We treat each excerpt as a partially labeled song and provide a label mapping, so that HLSD can be used together with other public datasets, such as SALAMI, RWC, and Isophonics. In cross-dataset evaluations, we find that including HLSD in training can improve state-of-the-art boundary detection and section labeling scores by ~3% and ~1% respectively.",

    "abstract": "The Audio Metaphor (AUME) demonstration invites participants to explore an interactive system for automatic soundscape composition. AUME is built as an online prompt-based system which produces audio soundscapes given a textual and affective query. The user can set valence and arousal curves which the system uses to generate a soundscape composition matching the desired eventfulness and mood. By streamlining the composition process, AUME aims to relieve some of the cognitive work done by sound designers. AUME's latest iteration draws from a database of nearly half a million audio files, each paired with a list of textual sound descriptors. Along with this expanded capacity, comes a refined ability to interpret a wider lexicon describing sound. Improvements to AUME\u2019s algorithms and architecture for sound retrieval, segmentation, background and foreground classification, automatic mixing and automatic soundscape affect recognition, makes it a powerful system that generates believable soundscapes at interactive rates.",

Many systems have been built that apply machine learning approaches to the problem of computer-assisted music composition (CAC). Calliope is a web application that assists composers in performing multi-track composition tasks in the symbolic domain. The composer can upload Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) files, visualize and edit MIDI tracks, and generate partial (via bar in-filling) or complete multi-track content using the Multi-Track Music Machine (MMM). Generation can be done in batch, and can be combined with active playback listening and ranking for an enhanced workflow. Generated MIDI files can be exported or streamed to any standard Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). We present the system\u2019s features and describe its co-creative workflow. Calliope can be used for creative ideation, musical exploration or for full multi-track music compositions.",
