Olaf is able to extract fingerprints from an audio stream, and either store those fingerprints in a database, or find a match between extracted fingerprints and stored fingerprints. It implements an algorithm similar to the one described in a classic ISMIR paper and has similar retrieval performance. It facilitates the many use cases acoustic fingerprinting has to offer such as duplicate detection, meta-data coupling, and synchronization.",

In this study we investigate relationships between computational features and human perception using real-world music spanning a variety of rhythmic categories. We observe a significant relationship between pulse clarity computed from the audio and inter-subject correlation of the neural responses. This finding suggests promising future lines of investigation integrating MIR audio features, neural correlation, and subjective behavioral reports in understanding beat processing and representation.",

Central to our approach is the inclusion of a shifting operation conducted over an additional, larger, tolerance window, which can substitute the combination of insertions and deletions. We describe a straightforward calculation of annotation efficiency and combine this with an informative visualisation which can be of use for the qualitative evaluation of beat tracking systems. We make our implementation and visualisation code freely available in a GitHub repository.",

In contrast to previous work, which represents musical material as a single time-ordered sequence, where the musical events corresponding to different tracks are interleaved, we create a time-ordered sequence of musical events for each track and concatenate several tracks into a single sequence. This takes advantage of the Transformer's attention-mechanism, which can adeptly handle long-term dependencies. We explore how various representations can offer the user a high degree of control at generation time, providing an interactive demo that accommodates track-level and bar-level inpainting, and offers control over track instrumentation and note density.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a technique for generating large collections of artificial training examples, which can be used to train chord labeling, key detection, and roman numeral analysis models. The technique consists of using roman numeral analysis annotations of existing datasets to generate harmonic reductions of the chords implied by the original annotations. The artificially generated examples ignore the original notes of the annotated example (i.e., the specific \"voicings\" of the chords), replacing them with voicings suggested by a rule-based voice leading algorithm. A relatively large number of artificial examples can be generated from a single annotated progression using this technique. For example, 10 different voicings in 12 different keys would result in 120 artificial examples generated out of one annotated chord progression. The voicings suggested for different keys do not necessarily overlap, given that the range of the voices and other variables are taken into account by the rule-based algorithm. This results in data augmentation with potentially unique voicings in each key, contrary to what would be obtained by simply transposing the artificial examples to a different key. We show the process of applying this technique to a dataset of annotated Bach chorales from the KernScores website. Similar datasets with roman numeral analysis annotations could be used with this approach to generate a large number of artificial training examples for training machine learning models.",

Several experiments have examined the \u201cimages\u201d of musical self-similarity, computed from acoustic features, which can provide a compelling visual representation of overall musical structure, but remain difficult to automatically interpret. In a recent trial, we directly trained and applied a robust visual object detection network on layered self-similarity matrices to identify musical segments (intro, verse, chorus) of a song, and highlight them using bounding boxes as done in visual object detection. We performed an initial assessment of this task using an \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d implementation, Facebook AI Research\u2019s Detectron2, of the Faster R-CNN recognition method on SSMs generated using audio features as separate \u201ccolor channels\u201d.

The proposed system takes in a short audio clip containing a guitar chord or note and produces estimates for the pitches present and their amplitudes. It trains without requiring labeled data. In an analysis part of the network, a convolutional neural network produces pitch estimates from an input spectrogram. These pitch estimates are fed into a synthesis part that attempts to reconstruct the original input. The analyzer trains while the synthesizer remains fixed, and a reconstruction loss is minimized. As the network improves its reconstructions, it learns to produce accurate pitch estimates. We discuss two variants for the synthesis part: component note synthesis and Karplus-Strong synthesis. We hope that insights from this work can be integrated into a full network for unsupervised acoustic guitar transcription.",

    "abstract": "We present a visualization tool for Convolutional Neural Networks focused on the task of instrument recognition. This tool allows you to visualize the network response layer by layer to a specific input sample as an array of animated activation plots corresponding to nodes, or filters, in the network. The recognition of instruments from audio, particularly in ensemble mixtures, remains a challenging and important problem fundamental to the field of music information retrieval. Early solutions to this problem focused heavily on designing task specific input features. These features were very well defined, however, their performance does not come close to state-of-the-art deep learning approaches such as convolutional neural networks, multi-task approaches, and transfer learning. However, the reported results of these black-box networks generally focus on overall performance across a dataset and ignore underlying instrument class performance disparities, which may overlook deeper issues with these approaches. Recently these types of deep learning approaches have become de facto standards for solving a wide variety of problems in the field of MIR. Still the underlying feature representations learned by these networks are not well understood in deep learning problems at large and even less in audio and spectrogram input specific cases. Our goal is to apply deep network and CNN analysis tools to the problem of predominant instrument recognition and create an analysis tool widely applicable and useful for MIR specific deep learning models.",

    "abstract": "Identification and availability of suitable data sources is a well-known difficulty in music information retrieval research. For studies requiring annotated data, this can be compounded by inconsistent presentation formats, differences in methodologies, and annotation errors. By building a framework to apply automated data cleansing and standardization techniques to a collection of MIREX evaluation output data, I was able to extract a large, labelled chord data set for use in a harmonic modelling study.",

    "abstract": "Research in automatic music transcription (AMT) showed significant improvement thanks to advances in deep learning. However, most of the research was designed for an offline scenario, where the input audio recording is provided from beginning to end. In this paper, we present an online piano AMT system with visualization using a web browser and MIDI export which works on CPU in real-time. We employed a model with auto-regressive LSTM and multi-note-state, which is adapted for an online scenario without losing its accuracy.",
