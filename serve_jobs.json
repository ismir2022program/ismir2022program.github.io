    "jd": "Chordify is a scale-up company that builds products based on state-of-the-art MIR technology to help musicians around the world to live their music. We are a holacratic organisation without bosses in which everybody has full autonomy to work on the tasks and projects that they believe they can have the biggest impact on reaching our common goals. Research at Chordify happens on a variety of MIR-related topics such as automatic chord estimation, beat-tracking, key estimation, polyphonic guitar transcription, music recommendation or automatic playlist generation. In addition, we also do research in fields that are not specifically focused on MIR such as natural language processing or user research. \n\n\n\nIn case you would like to join us in one of our offices, in Utrecht or Groningen, the Netherlands, for an internship to do research in one or multiple of the above mentioned fields feel free to reach out to us via research-internships@chordify.net. Please include a short presentation of your research background and your motivation to join our team. You can also keep an eye on the Chordify jobs page for openings and more information about Chordify and the team. Don't hesitate to write to us if you want to get to know us better.",
