    "description": "Symbolic music formats (e.g., MIDI, MusicXML/MEI) can provide a variety of high-level musical information like note pitch and duration, key/time signature, beat/downbeat position, etc. Such data can be used as both input/training data and as ground truth for MIR systems.\n \n This tutorial aims to provide an introduction to symbolic music processing for a broad MIR audience, with a particular focus on showing how to extract relevant MIR features from symbolic musical formats in a fast, intuitive, and scalable way. We do this with the aid of the Python package Partitura. To target different kinds of symbolic data, we use an extended version of the ASAP Dataset, a multi-modal dataset that contains MusicXML scores, MIDI performances, audio performances, and score-to-performance alignments.\n \n The tutorial will be structured in four parts: The first part provides an introduction to the topic of symbolic music processing. The second, third, and fourth parts are hands-on tutorials that showcase the structure of the Partitura package (including its relation to other popular Python packages for symbolic music processing), how to extract common MIR features, and how to work with symbolic multimodal datasets, respectively.\n \n The motivation behind this tutorial is to promote research on symbolic music processing in the MIR community. Therefore, we target a broad audience of researchers without requiring prior knowledge of this particular area. For the hands-on parts of the tutorial, we presuppose some practical experience with the Python language, but we will provide well-documented step-by-step access to the code in the form of Google Colab notebooks, which will be made publicly available after the tutorial. Furthermore, some familiarity with the basic concepts of statistics and machine learning is useful.",

Projects such as CompMusic (2011-2017), MusicalBridges (2018-2022) or the initiatives funded by SPARC (2019-2022) have demonstrated the importance of considering sociocultural specifics of a music tradition to effectively define research problems, collect data and propose methods for analysis. These projects have made particularly notable contributions to the analysis of Indian Art Music (IAM), leading to a collective body of bespoke computational methods for analyzing these traditions.\n \n Through this tutorial we aim to compile and present such works, making openly available a number of software tools and materials developed by MIR researchers working on the two main IAM traditions, Carnatic and Hindustani. The content will be organized into five sections: (1) datasets and corpora, (2) melodic analysis, (3) rhythmic analysis, (4) timbral analysis and (5) structural analysis. Each topic will include an introduction covering the basic musical concepts required to understand its constituent tasks, followed by a practical presentation of the materials and software tools compiled.\n \n This tutorial is the result of an ongoing collaborative effort involving many contributors. The software will be available in Python through a single Github repository, containing clear and reproducible implementations of the presented methodologies. A Jupyter WebBook will be the main tutorial reference, in which we will introduce all the materials, contextualize the software tools, and include Jupyter Notebook examples for most of the research tasks covered.",

    "description": "Advances in deep learning and signal processing research have made it possible to generate signals that at times can be difficult to distinguish from real samples. Despite the realistic output the models can produce, however, the controllability of the models is still constrained because of the black-box-like nature of many models.\n \n In this tutorial, we aim to introduce considerations researchers can take into account for a better end-user experience. We would like to focus in particular on how to design deep generative models with intuitive control of music audio signals, specifically vocal and instrumental performance. To this end, we will first present a broad review of up-to-date generative models for singing voices and musical instrument performance. Then, we will share our own research results and insights regarding both the implicit and explicit controllability of the deep learning models. In the section on presenting controllable models for instrumental performance synthesis, we will include a walk-through of the building, training, and control of the DDSP and MIDI-DDSP models via Jupyter (Colab) Notebook with Python and Tensorflow.\n \n The target audience for this tutorial is researchers who are interested in deep generative models for monophonic signals, especially for singing voice and musical instruments. We expect the audience to have a basic understanding of machine learning concepts for audio signal processing.",

    "description": "While deep neural networks achieved promising results in many MIR tasks, they typically require a large amount of labeled data for training. Rare, fine-grained, or newly emerged classes (e.g. a rare musical instrument, a new music genre) where large-scale data collection is hard or simply impossible are often considered out-of-vocabulary and unsupported by MIR systems. To address this, few-shot learning (FSL) and zero-shot learning (ZSL) are learning paradigms that aim to train a model that can learn a new concept based on just a handful of labeled examples (few-shot) or some auxiliary information (zero-shot), mimicking human ability. By doing so, the trained model is no longer limited to a pre-defined and fixed set of classes but ideally can generalize to any class of interest with the cost of little human intervention. In addition, few-shot and zero-shot models naturally incorporate human input without asking for significant effort, making them useful tools when developing MIR systems that can be customized by individual users.\n \n In this tutorial, we will go over\n FSL/ZSL foundations - Task definition and existing approaches.\n Recent advances of FSL/ZSL in MIR - Techniques and contributions in recent studies. We will also discuss the remaining challenges and future directions.\n Coding examples - Showcasing the training and evaluation pipeline of FSL and ZSL models on specific MIR tasks. Code and references to the tools and datasets will be provided.\n \n We aim for this tutorial to be useful to researchers and practitioners in the ISMIR community who are facing labeled data scarcity issues, looking for new interaction paradigms between users and MIR systems, or generally interested in the techniques and applications of FSL and ZSL. We assume the audience is familiar with the basic machine learning concepts.",

    "description": "Mixing is a central task within audio post-production where expert knowledge is required to deliver professional quality content, encompassing both technical and creative considerations. Recently, deep learning approaches have been introduced that aim to address this challenge by generating a cohesive mixture of a set of recordings as would an audio engineer. These approaches leverage large-scale datasets and therefore have the potential to outperform traditional approaches based on expert systems, but bring their own unique set of challenges. In this tutorial, we will begin by providing an introduction to the mixing process from the perspective of an audio engineer, along with a discussion of the tools used in the process from a signal processing perspective. We will then discuss a series of recent deep learning approaches and relevant datasets, providing code to build, train, and evaluate these systems. Future directions and challenges will be discussed, including new deep learning systems, evaluation methods, and approaches to address dataset availability. Our goal is to provide a starting point for researchers working in MIR who have little to no experience in audio engineering so they can easily begin addressing problems in this domain. In addition, our tutorial may be of interest to researchers outside of MIR, but with a background in audio engineering or signal processing, who are interested in gaining exposure to current approaches in deep learning.",

A code of ethics represents a specific list of values and behaviors that a research community either endorses or objects to. Codes of ethics have been established on the general level of engineering associations (IEEE, ACM), but also more specifically by research communities such as NIME. Whereas ISMIR has seen a series of tutorials on ethics and values, and guidelines have been proposed (https://ismir.net/resources/ethics/), these attempts have not yet manifested into a official code of ethics. Does ISMIR need such a code? What is the function of the code? How can we establish and maintain such a code? What are the main ethical concerns regarding ISMIR research and practice?",

    "description": "Indian art music continues to evolve in current performance practice, while staying within the framework provided by some of the immutable axiomatic concepts that define the music culture. The changes that lead the evolution of the music culture are guided by practitioners and influenced by the evolving socio-cultural, socio-political or performance and aesthetic considerations. In this talk, we focus on the evolution of Indian art music from the perspective of performance and aesthetics, highlighting some important milestones around the melodic and rhythmic systems in Indian art music. Focusing on recent developments and our own influences on performance practice and aesthetics, we discuss our effort and approaches to create more inclusive roles in music composition and performance. We further aim to provide concrete examples and formulations of the abstractions in current performance and aesthetics. We propose thoughts and ideas that can help current MIR formulations and solutions to go beyond the limiting assumptions based on current music performance practices and (often rigid) structures, and focus on the music abstractions that are more fundamental to our understanding, appreciation and analysis of Indian art music.",

    "description": "The increasing capabilities for machine learning algorithms is enabling the usage of ML models for a variety of tasks including for creativity such as generating new music and modifying existing music. Similar applications are present in different kinds of audio signals such as voice biometrics, speaker and speech recognition. However, these technologies that support creativity can also be used for malicious purposes. Deepfake audios are one such technology which enable flawlessly altering existing audio signals or creating new signals from any given text. Audio can also be integrated with videos to provide a complete multimodal experience, which can be purely synthetic and fake. While there is significant research ongoing in image and video, the space of detecting these anomalies in audio processing is relatively unaddressed. We will discuss some of these possible adventures of machine learning in audio processing and the research efforts that we are undertaking to detect them. In addition, we will also discuss the bias and fairness issues in audio processing where we will highlight \"out of distribution\" behavior of popular approaches and some strategies to address them.",

TISMIR retains the Open Access model of the ISMIR Conference proceedings, encourages reproducibility of the published research papers, and maintains a low publication cost. Almost 5 years later, this ISMIR 2022 is devoted to discuss and brainstorm on the current status and future perspectives of the journal with a series of TISMIR recent and potential authors, reviewers and editors. We will address the following questions, and others proposed by participants: What do you appreciate more about TISMIR? What is the link and complementarity to the ISMIR conference? Which are the main challenges/limitations that need to be addressed? How to make TISMIR competitive as a journal in the current publication landscape? How to engage with more community members in order to make TISMIR a success? Which are future avenues for conference vs journal outlets in the ISMIR field?",

    "description": "The Late-breaking/Demo (LBD) session is a forum for sharing prototype systems, initial concepts, and early results which may have not yet fully matured but are of interest to the Music-IR community. It is also a great entry point for people who are new to ISMIR to showcase their preliminary work and receive early feedback from fellow researchers. Attendees of the LBD can interact with demos or discuss their thoughts on the latest developments in the field.",
